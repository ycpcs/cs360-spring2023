Book Questions from *Introduction to Algorithms - 3rd ed.*
==========================================================

23.1-2, 23.2-4, 23.2-5, 24.1-1 (8 points), 24.3-1 (7 points)

*Hints:*

> But since \|*E*\| \< \|*V*<sup>2</sup>\|, O(lg *E*) = O(lg *V*<sup>2</sup>) = O(2 lg *V*) = O(lg *V*) and hence O(*E* lg *E*) = O(E lg V). Which parts can be improved if we know the range of edge weights?

> Consider using an array rather than a heap. How does this affect the above parts when the range of weights in known?
