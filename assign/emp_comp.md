## Empirical Sorting Comparison

The purpose of this assignment is to compare the various sorting algorithms implemented in assignments 1, 2, and 3.

## Submission

The submission for this assignment should consist of a written report that graphically shows the results for all five sorts and provides a discussion of what was observed. **DO NOT** include your completed source code, but provide tables of numerical data in an appendix at the end of the report.

The report should include *meaningful* plots (e.g. using Excel) of all the data showing *important* comparison characteristics. There should be a summary table listing the sort method, asymptotic behavior, and empirical asymptotic formula with "best-fit" constants.
	
**DISCUSS** the results in terms of observed behavior (e.g. how well does the asymptotic behavior match the empirical data), comparison of behaviors between sorts (e.g. which ones perform better at which data set sizes), comparison of hidden constants for sorts with the same asymptotic behaviors, and any other important observed features. The discussion should refer to the graphs when appropriate to illustrate each aspect. Some questions that should be answered with graphs and brief textual explanations include:

>-   Does the empirical constant vary for each sort based on element range? Briefly explain why/why not?

>-   How well does the empirical data for each sort fit the asymptotic trend curve, particularly for *small* data sets? Show a graph with the empirical data and trend curves for all sorts.

>-   Which sorts have the best runtime for *small* data sets, i.e. *small n*, for the small element range? Show a graph with the empirical data for all sorts.

>-   Which sorts have the best runtime for *small* data sets, i.e. *small n*, for the large element range? Show a graph with the empirical data for all sorts.

>-   Which sorts have the best runtime for *large* data sets, i.e. *large n*, for the small element range? Show a graph with the empirical data for all sorts. 

>-   Which sorts have the best runtime for *large* data sets, i.e. *large n*, for the large element range? Show a graph with the empirical data for all sorts.

>-   How do the *n lg n* sorts compare to each other for the small element ranges both in terms of runtime and memory usage? 

>-   How do the *n lg n* sorts compare to each other for the large element ranges both in terms of runtime and memory usage? 

**SUMMARIZE** the results by describing under what conditions you would select which sort, i.e. if you were asked to sort a data set, what criteria would you use in making your selection?
